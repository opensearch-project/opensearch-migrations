# Data Generator

This tool is used to generate data for testing a search cluster. The workloads are similar to those of [OpenSearch Benchmark](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Benchmark).

> **⚠️ Test Infrastructure**  
> This tool is for test infrastructure. Features may change without notice, and backward compatibility is not guaranteed.

## Workloads

The following workloads are supported and can be controlled with the `--workloads [workload1] [workload2] [...]`: `HTTP_LOGS`, `GEONAMES`, `NESTED`, `NYC_TAXIS`.

### HTTP_LOGS

Multiple indices with HTTP request log file entries that include client IP, timestamp, and request details.

### GEONAMES

A single index containing a list of geographic features from all over the world.

### NESTED

A single index of Stack Overflow questions with user IDs and timestamps, along with answers containing user IDs and timestamps, using the nested mapping type.

### NYC_TAXIS

A single index of taxi trip record data from every time a taxi dropped off a fare in the area.

## Run Data Generator

This tool can be used from the command line and programmatically. The programmatic approach is recommended.

### Run workloads programmatically

Insert the following code into the test case:

```java
import org.opensearch.migrations.data.WorkloadGenerator;
import org.opensearch.migrations.data.WorkloadOptions;

// Create or use an existing OpenSearchClient
var client = new OpenSearchClient(...);

// Create an instance
var generator = new WorkloadGenerator(client);

// Pass workload options to the generate method, in this case using the defaults
generator.generate(new WorkloadOptions());
```

### Generate data via Gradle

To upload data onto a test cluster, use the following command:

```shell
./gradlew DataGenerator:run --args='--target-host http://hostname:9200'
```
