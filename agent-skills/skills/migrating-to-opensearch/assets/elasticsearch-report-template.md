# Elasticsearch / OpenSearch Migration Report Template

You MUST use this structure exactly when emitting the final Elasticsearch-to-OpenSearch (or OpenSearch-upgrade) migration report. It mirrors [solr-report-template.md](solr-report-template.md) section-for-section so both source families produce the same detailed shape — only the source-specific columns differ. Draft every section from the embedded tables in [source-elasticsearch.md](../references/source-elasticsearch.md) / [source-opensearch.md](../references/source-opensearch.md); tag version-volatile values `[verify]` and resolve them in the Step 8 batch.

## Required sections

```markdown
# Elasticsearch → Amazon OpenSearch Migration Assessment

**Generated:** <ISO 8601 timestamp>
**Source:** Elasticsearch <version>, <distribution: Elastic | OSS>, <license: ELv2/SSPL flag>, <node count> nodes, <index count> indexes
**Target:** Amazon OpenSearch Service in <region>
**Stakeholder:** <Search Relevance Engineer | DevOps / Platform Engineer | Business Stakeholder>

## 1. Executive Summary

- Migration complexity: **Low | Medium | High** (with one-line justification)
- Estimated effort: **<S/M/L>** (engineer-weeks)
- Top 3 risks: <bulleted, one line each>
- Recommended target: <OpenSearch Service | OpenSearch Serverless NextGen> — one-sentence reason
- Recommended path: <from the ES version-family table in source-elasticsearch.md>

## 2. Schema / Mapping

| ES field | ES type | OpenSearch field | OpenSearch type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

You MUST include the full OpenSearch index template (mappings + settings) as a code block — use [elasticsearch-index-template-skeleton.md](elasticsearch-index-template-skeleton.md).
You MUST call out any `_type`/multi-type flattening, `fielddata:true` strip, `dense_vector`→`knn_vector`, `flattened`→`flat_object`, runtime-field pre-compute, or `_source:false` index that required action.

## 3. Query / API Translation

For each representative query or API call the user provided (or a representative set you inferred):

### Q<n>: <one-line description>
- **Elasticsearch:** `<original query / API>`
- **OpenSearch:**
  ```json
  { ... }
  ```
- **Notes:** ES Query DSL is largely identical in OpenSearch; flag the deltas — `retriever`/`rrf` → hybrid query + normalization-processor, ELSER `text_expansion` → `neural_sparse`, scripted/runtime fields, `_type` in endpoints, X-Pack-only query clauses.

## 4. Plugins, Auth & Operations

- Plugins: map `_cat/plugins` output (Open Distro `opendistro-*` → `opensearch-*` rename cheat-sheet in [compatibility-rubric.md](../references/compatibility-rubric.md) §4). Supported-plugin list on managed AOS is `[verify]`.
- ILM → ISM (rewrite policies — HIGH); Watcher → Alerting (rebuild monitors — HIGH).
- Auth backends (basic / SAML / OIDC / Kerberos / LDAP / IAM-SigV4 / mTLS): map roles + role-mappings to OpenSearch Security.

## 5. Sizing Recommendation

| Tier | Instance type | Count | Storage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hot | | | | |
| UltraWarm | | | | (omit if not used) |
| Cold | | | | (omit if not used) |

- Primary shards: <n> (from the shard-sizing formula in [sizing-formulas.md](../references/sizing-formulas.md))
- Replicas: <n>
- JVM heap: <Amazon OpenSearch Service auto-sets heap by instance class — record the service-managed value; `[verify]` the per-instance recommendation>
- Index management policy: <ISM JSON or summary>

## 6. Feature Gap Register

You MUST use the canonical 7-column shape from [elasticsearch-gap-register.md](elasticsearch-gap-register.md):

| # | Feature | Elasticsearch behavior | OpenSearch alternative | Severity | Effort | Owner action |
|---|---------|------------------------|------------------------|----------|--------|--------------|

Required entries: every ES feature you flagged in steps 3, 4, and 6. Severity values come from [compatibility-rubric.md](../references/compatibility-rubric.md).

## 7. Security Configuration

See SKILL.md "Security Considerations" for the canonical recommendations. You MUST confirm in the report that each control is in place. You MUST NOT duplicate the full text here.

## 8. Migration Plan, Timeline & Resourcing

Phase plan with calendar duration, effort (engineer-weeks), and owner role, composed per [`timeline-and-resourcing.md`](../references/timeline-and-resourcing.md). Timeline and effort are ranges with assumptions — **not** dollar estimates (cost → <https://calculator.aws>).

| Phase | Goal | Tooling | Calendar | Effort (eng-wk) | Owner role | Exit criterion |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Assess | Confirm gaps and finalize target topology | this report | _1 wk_ | _0.5_ | Business Stakeholder + technical lead | sign-off |
| Provision | Stand up domain + IaC + security + tooling | CloudFormation / Migration Assistant on EKS | | | DevOps / Platform Engineer | target reachable |
| PoC + spike | Prove the weakest readiness dimension (required if YELLOW) | sample restore | | | both technical roles | approach confirmed |
| Schema + query rebuild | Audit MA mappings; rebuild ILM→ISM / Watcher→Alerting / runtime fields | MA metadata + OpenSearch DSL | | | Search Relevance Engineer | top-N parity ≥ 95% |
| Reindex | Move data | <Snapshot/Restore if ES ≤ 7.10.2; else Migration Assistant RFS; OpenSearch source: in-place blue/green or snapshot> | _≈ source ÷ throughput `[verify]`_ | | DevOps / Platform Engineer | parity sample passes |
| Dual-write / Replay | Validate live traffic on both | <MA Capture & Replay for zero-downtime; else dual-write> | | | application team | error rate within SLO |
| Cutover | Flip read traffic | client config | _1 wk_ | | both technical roles | rollback rehearsed |
| Decommission | Retire source | — | _after rollback window_ | | DevOps / Platform Engineer | data retained per policy |

**Total:** end-to-end **<X–Y weeks>** · **<N–M engineer-weeks>** · critical path = **<phase that sets the date>**.
**Resourcing:** _<which roles, how many, part-time/parallel>._
**Commitment:** readiness-tier gated — GREEN = committable; YELLOW = after the PoC/spike; RED = spike duration only.

## 9. Sizing Inputs for AWS Pricing Calculator

- Compute inputs: <instance type, count, region — plug into <https://calculator.aws>>
- Storage inputs: <total GB, storage type (gp3 / OR1 / UltraWarm / Cold)>
- Cost-saving levers: <UltraWarm threshold, ISM rollover, instance right-sizing, RI/Serverless NextGen>

> You MUST plug these values into the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws) for an authoritative dollar figure that reflects your account's RI / Savings Plan / EDP discounts. This skill MUST NOT estimate dollars because pricing changes monthly and account-specific discount math is unverifiable by an LLM.

## 10. Open Questions

You MUST confirm these items with the user before locking the plan.

## 11. References / Citations

The single canonical provenance record. List every `[verify]`-resolved claim's source URL with a retrieval timestamp, plus the reference files consulted for stable-core facts. For the retrieval recipe see [`knowledge-retrieval.md`](../references/knowledge-retrieval.md).
```

## Constraints

- You MUST emit every section above, in order.
- You MUST omit a section's body only if explicitly inapplicable (e.g. no UltraWarm tier). You MUST keep the heading and write "Not applicable: <reason>".
- You MUST save the file as `elasticsearch-to-opensearch-migration-report.md` (or `opensearch-upgrade-migration-report.md` for OS sources) unless the user specifies a different name.
- You MUST NOT invent numbers because fabricated figures mislead sizing and cost decisions. Every cost or sizing figure MUST trace to inputs from the user or to a cited reference.
- For OpenSearch-upgrade sources, retitle to "OpenSearch <from> → <to> Upgrade Assessment", drive section 2/3 from [source-opensearch.md](../references/source-opensearch.md) breaking-changes, and make section 8 the in-place blue/green sequence (stepping-stone via OS 2.19 for 1.x→3.x).
