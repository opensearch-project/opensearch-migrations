# Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base is the collection of expectations we have about the behavior of clusters of various versions and across upgrades.

It can be used in various ways, but was designed to be a component of the Upgrade Testing Framework. There is more extensive documentation of how it works in [experimental/upgrades/README.md](../upgrades/README.md).

Further discussion on adding additional expectations to this knowledge base, can be found in the PR [here](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations/pull/68)
