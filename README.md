## OpenSearch Migrations

```
Data flows to OpenSearch
On wings of the morning breeze
Effortless migration
```

This repo will contain code and documentation to assist in migrations and upgrades of OpenSearch clusters.

## Setup for commits

Developers must run the "install_githooks.sh" script in order to add the pre-commit hook.

## Docker Solution

The TrafficCapture directory hosts a set of projects designed to facilitate the proxying and capturing of HTTP
traffic, which can then be offloaded and replayed to other HTTP server(s).

More documentation on this solution can be found here:
[TrafficCapture README](TrafficCapture/README.md)
