## Overview

The OpenSearch Migrations Engine is a comprehensive set of tools designed to facilitate upgrades, migrations, and comparisons for OpenSearch and Elasticsearch clusters. This project aims to simplify the process of moving between different versions and platforms while ensuring data integrity and performance.

## Key Features

- **Upgrade and Migration Support**: Provides tools for migrating between different versions of Elasticsearch and OpenSearch.
  - **[Metadata Migration](MetadataMigration/README.md)**: Migrate essential cluster components such as configuration, settings, templates, and aliases.
  - **Multi-Version Upgrade**: Easily migrate across major versions (e.g., from Elasticsearch 6.8 to OpenSearch 2.15), skipping intermediate upgrades and reducing time and risk.
  - **Downgrade Support**: Downgrade to an earlier version if needed (e.g., from Elasticsearch 7.17 to 7.10.2).
  - **Existing Data Migration with [Reindex-from-Snapshot](RFS/docs/DESIGN.md)**: Migrate indices and documents using snapshots, updating your data to the latest Lucene version quickly without impacting the target cluster.
  - **Live Traffic Capture with [Capture-and-Replay](docs/TrafficCaptureAndReplayDesign.md)**: Capture live traffic from the source cluster and replay it on the target cluster for validation. This ensures the target cluster can handle real-world traffic patterns before fully migrating.
  
- **Zero-Downtime Migration with [Live Traffic Routing](docs/ClientTrafficSwinging.md)**: Tools to seamlessly switch client traffic between clusters while keeping services fully operational.

- **Migration Rollback**: Keep your source cluster synchronized during the migration, allowing you to monitor the target cluster's performance before fully committing to the switch. You can safely revert if needed.

- **User-Friendly Interface via [Migration Console](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations/blob/main/docs/migration-console.md)**: Command Line Interface (CLI) that guides you through each migration step.

- **Flexible Deployment Options**:
  - **[AWS Deployment](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/migration-assistant-for-amazon-opensearch-service/)**: Fully automated deployment to AWS.
  - **[Local Docker Deployment](/TrafficCapture/dockerSolution/README.md)**: Run the solution locally in a container for testing and development.
  - Contribute to add more deployment options.

Note that testing is done on specific minor versions, but any minor versions within a listed major version are expected to work.

### Platforms
  - Self-managed (cloud provider hosted)
  - Self-managed (on-premises)
  - Managed cloud offerings (e.g., Amazon OpenSearch)

### Performance Limitations
A performance test was performed on 03/10/25 alongside [PR 1337](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-migrations/pull/1337)
to identify general indexing throughput with Reindex-From-Snapshot and Traffic Replay. While Reindex-From-Snapshot
includes periods of ingestion inactivity (e.g. while downloading the shard data), this was not factored into the ingestion rates.
Test used docs with an average uncompressed size 2.39 KB (source doc and index command) which corresponded to 1.54 KB of primary shard size per doc on OS 2.17 with default settings

For real-word use, throughput can be increased by vertically scaling Reindex-From-Snapshot and Traffic Replay instances or horizontally scaling
the Reindex-From-Snapshot workers that are running on AWS Fargate. Outside the exception indicated, all cases are CPU limited for throughput.
All cases were using uncompressed network traffic generated by the applications, results will vary if using client compression.

Throughput here is measured by the rate of increase in primary shard data with bulk ingestion on the target cluster alongside
the uncompressed size of the source data ingested.

Tests were ran with and without the [Type Mapping Sanitization Transformer](./transformation/transformationPlugins/jsonMessageTransformers/jsonTypeMappingsSanitizationTransformer/README.md).

#### Test Results
| Service               | vCPU | Memory (GB) | Type Mapping Sanitization | Peak Docs Ingested per minute | Primary Shard Data Ingestion Rate (MBps) | Uncompressed Source Data Ingestion Rate (MBps) |
