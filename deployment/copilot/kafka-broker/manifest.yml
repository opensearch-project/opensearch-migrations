# This is a non-essential experimental service to test running Kafka within ECS. It has no volume, is a single broker, and will be recreated in
# dev environment deployments. With this in mind, it should only be used on a test basis.

# Your service name will be used in naming your resources like log groups, ECS services, etc.
