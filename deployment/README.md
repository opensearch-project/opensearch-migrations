### Deployment
This directory is aimed at housing deployment/distribution methods for various migration related images and infrastructure. It is not specific to any given platform and should be expanded to more platforms as needed. 

It is worth noting that there is not a hard divide between these subdirectories and deployments such as [opensearch-service-migration](./cdk/opensearch-service-migration) will use Dockerfiles in the [docker](./docker) directory for some of its container deployments.


### Deploying Migration solution to AWS

**Note**: These features are still under development and subject to change

Detailed instructions for deploying the CDK and setting up its prerequisites can be found in the opensearch-service-migration [README](./cdk/opensearch-service-migration/README.md). This could involve setting CDK context parameters to customize your OpenSearch Service Domain and VPC as well as setting needed migration parameters. A sample **testing** `cdk.context.json` for an E2E migration setup could be:
```
{
  "engineVersion": "OS_1.3",
  "domainName": "aos-test-domain",
  "dataNodeCount": 2,
  "vpcEnabled": true,
  "availabilityZoneCount": 2,
  "openAccessPolicyEnabled": true,
  "domainRemovalPolicy": "DESTROY",
  "migrationAssistanceEnabled": true,
  "MSKARN": "arn:aws:kafka:us-east-1:123456789123:cluster/logging-msk-cluster/123456789-12bd-4f34-932b-52060474aa0f-7",
  "MSKBrokers": [
    "b-2-public.loggingmskcluster.abc123.c7.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9198",
    "b-1-public.loggingmskcluster.abc123.c7.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9198"
  ],
  "MSKTopic": "logging-traffic-topic"
}
```



Once prerequisites are met and context parameters are set, deploying the resources to AWS can be done simply by running the following command:
```
cdk deploy "*"
```
