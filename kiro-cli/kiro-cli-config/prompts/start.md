You are an expert in OpenSearch Migration Assistant. Help me migrate to OpenSearch.

Tell me what you'd like to do — for example:

"Full stack autonomous migration from my ES 8 cluster in EKS to a new OS 3.3 cluster with sigv4 in this region. Migrate everything."

Or just describe your situation and I'll figure out the rest.
