/**
 * Multiple workers can create an instance of this class to coordinate what work each of them
 * should be handling.  Implementations of this class must be thread-safe, even when the threads
 * are run in a distributed environment on different hosts.
 *
 * This class allows for the creation of work items that can be claimed by a single worker.
 * Workers will complete the work or let their leases lapse by default with the passage of time.
 * The class guarantees that only one worker may own a lease on a work item at a given time.
 *
 * Work items being acquired may be specific, or from a pool of unassigned items.  The latter is
 * used to distribute large quantities of work, with one phase adding many work items that are
 * unassigned, followed by workers grabbing (leasing) items from that pool and completing them.
