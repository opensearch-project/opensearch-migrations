# Create Index API

## Overview

The Create Index API allows you to add a new index to your Elasticsearch cluster. This powerful feature enables you to customize various aspects of your index, including its settings, mappings, and aliases.

## API Endpoint

```
PUT /<index>
```

Replace `<index>` with your desired index name.

## Prerequisites

To use this API, you must have either the `create_index` or `manage` index privilege if Elasticsearch security features are enabled.

## Index Naming Rules

When choosing a name for your index, adhere to these guidelines:

- Use lowercase letters only
- Avoid these characters: `\`, `/`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`, ` ` (space), `,`, `#`
- Don't start with `-`, `_`, or `+`
- Avoid `.` or `..` as standalone names
- Keep names under 255 bytes (note: multi-byte characters count faster towards this limit)
- Avoid names starting with `.` (except for hidden and plugin-managed internal indices)

Note: Index names containing `:` (colon) are deprecated since version 7.0.

## Request Body

The request body can include the following optional components:

1. `settings`: Configure index-specific settings
2. `mappings`: Define field types and properties
3. `aliases`: Set up index aliases

### Index Settings

Customize your index configuration using the `settings` object:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 3,
    "number_of_replicas": 2
  }
}
```

- `number_of_shards`: Defaults to 1 if not specified
- `number_of_replicas`: Defaults to 1 (one replica per primary shard) if not specified

For more detailed settings, refer to the index modules documentation.

### Mappings

Define the structure of your documents using the `mappings` object:

```json
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "field1": { "type": "text" }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: Prior to Elasticsearch 7.0, mappings included a type name. While deprecated, you can still include a type by setting the `include_type_name` parameter.

### Aliases

Create index aliases within the `aliases` object:

```json
{
  "aliases": {
    "alias_1": {},
    "alias_2": {
      "filter": {
        "term": { "user.id": "kimchy" }
      },
      "routing": "shard-1"
    }
  }
}
```

## Query Parameters

- `include_type_name` (Optional): Set to `true` to include a type name in mappings (deprecated)
- `wait_for_active_shards` (Optional, string): Specify the number of active shard copies required before proceeding. Options:
  - A positive integer up to the total number of shards (`number_of_replicas+1`)
  - `"all"`
  Default: 1 (the primary shard)
- `master_timeout` (Optional): Specify how long to wait for a connection to the master node. Default: 30s
- `timeout` (Optional): Set the operation timeout

## Response

A successful index creation returns a JSON response:

```json
{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "shards_acknowledged": true,
  "index": "test"
}
```

- `acknowledged`: Indicates if the index was successfully created in the cluster
- `shards_acknowledged`: Shows if the required number of shard copies were started before timeout
- `index`: The name of the created index

Note: Even if `acknowledged` or `shards_acknowledged` is `false`, the index creation might still succeed but not complete before the timeout. These values indicate whether the operation completed before the timeout.

## Waiting for Active Shards

Control the number of active shards to wait for using either:

1. Index setting `index.write.wait_for_active_shards`:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "index.write.wait_for_active_shards": "2"
  }
}
```

2. Request parameter `wait_for_active_shards`:

```
PUT /test?wait_for_active_shards=2
```

This setting affects the `wait_for_active_shards` value on all subsequent write operations.

# Update Index Alias API

This API allows you to add, remove, or modify index aliases in Elasticsearch, providing a flexible way to reference one or more indices.

## Overview

An index alias is a secondary name for one or more indices. Most Elasticsearch APIs accept an alias in place of an index name, offering enhanced flexibility in data management.

## API Endpoint

```
POST /_aliases
```

## Security Considerations

When Elasticsearch security features are enabled, the following index privileges are required:

- For `add` or `remove` actions: `manage` privilege on both the index and alias
- For `remove_index` action: `manage` privilege on the index

## Request Body Structure

The request body consists of an `actions` array, containing objects that define the operations to perform:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": { 
        "parameter1": "value1",
        "parameter2": "value2"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Action Types

1. `add`: Add an alias
2. `remove`: Remove an alias
3. `remove_index`: Remove an index (use with caution)

### Common Parameters

- `index` or `indices`: Specify target index/indices (required if not using `indices`)
- `alias` or `aliases`: Specify alias name(s) (required for add/remove actions)
- `filter`: Apply a query filter to the alias
- `routing`: Set custom routing for the alias
- `is_write_index`: Designate an index as the write index for an alias
- `is_hidden`: If true, the alias is hidden
- `expand_wildcards`: Expand wildcard expressions to concrete indices
- `must_exist`: If true, the alias must exist to perform the action

## Usage Examples

### Adding an Alias

```json
POST /_aliases
{
  "actions": [
    { "add": { "index": "my-index-000001", "alias": "alias1" } }
  ]
}
```

### Removing an Alias

```json
POST /_aliases
{
  "actions": [
    { "remove": { "index": "test1", "alias": "alias1" } }
  ]
}
```

### Renaming an Alias

```json
POST /_aliases
{
  "actions": [
    { "remove": { "index": "test1", "alias": "alias1" } },
    { "add": { "index": "test1", "alias": "alias2" } }
  ]
}
```

### Multiple Index Association

```json
POST /_aliases
{
  "actions": [
    { "add": { "indices": ["test1", "test2"], "alias": "alias1" } }
  ]
}
```

You can also use wildcard patterns to associate an alias with multiple indices:

```json
POST /_aliases
{
  "actions": [
    { "add": { "index": "test*", "alias": "all_test_indices" } }
  ]
}
```

Note: This creates a point-in-time alias for currently matching indices and doesn't automatically update for future matching indices.

## Advanced Features

### Filtered Aliases

Create aliases with query filters for customized index views:

```json
POST /_aliases
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "add": {
        "index": "my-index-000001",
        "alias": "alias2",
        "filter": { "term": { "user.id": "kimchy" } }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Custom Routing

Optimize shard operations by associating routing values with aliases:

```json
POST /_aliases
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "add": {
        "index": "test",
        "alias": "alias2",
        "search_routing": "1,2",
        "index_routing": "2"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Write Index

Designate a specific index as the write target for an alias:

```json
POST /_aliases
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "add": {
        "index": "test",
        "alias": "alias1",
        "is_write_index": true
      }
    },
    {
      "add": {
        "index": "test2",
        "alias": "alias1"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Only one index per alias can be assigned as the write index. If no write index is specified and multiple indices are referenced by an alias, writes will be rejected.

## Best Practices

1. Use descriptive alias names for clarity
2. Regularly review and update alias configurations
3. Be cautious when using `remove_index` action
4. Leverage filtered aliases for efficient data access patterns
5. Utilize the write index feature for controlled write operations
6. Avoid indexing to an alias that points to multiple indices
7. Be aware that swapping an index with an alias may cause temporary failures for in-flight requests

# Elasticsearch Index Management

## Index Modules

Index Modules are specialized components that manage various aspects of an individual index in Elasticsearch. They play a crucial role in controlling index-specific behaviors and settings.

## Index Settings

Elasticsearch allows for granular control over index behavior through index-level settings. These settings come in two flavors:

1. Static settings: Configured at index creation and cannot be changed afterwards.
2. Dynamic settings: Can be modified on live indices.

> **Warning**: Modifying static or dynamic settings on a closed index may lead to irreconcilable configuration issues, potentially requiring index deletion and recreation.

## Static Index Settings

Here are the key static index settings not associated with specific index modules:

### Primary Shards (`index.number_of_shards`)

- **Default**: 1
- **Description**: Defines the number of primary shards for an index.
- **Constraints**: 
  - Can only be set during index creation.
  - Maximum of 1024 shards per index (adjustable via system property).

### Routing Shards (`index.number_of_routing_shards`)

- **Description**: Determines the number of routing shards used for index splitting.
- **Example**: An index with 5 shards and 30 routing shards allows splitting by factors of 2 or 3.
- **Default**: Calculated based on the number of primary shards to allow splitting up to 1024 shards.

### Shard Corruption Check (`index.shard.check_on_startup`)

- **Options**: 
  - `false`: No check
  - `checksum`: Basic check
  - `true`: Thorough check (CPU and memory intensive)
- **Note**: Checking large indices may be time-consuming.

### Compression Codec (`index.codec`)

- **Options**: 
  - `default`
  - `best_compression`

### Other Static Settings

- `index.routing_partition_size`
- `index.soft_deletes.enabled`
- `index.soft_deletes.retention_lease.period` (Default: 12h)
- `index.load_fixed_bitset_filters_eagerly`
- `index.hidden`

## Dynamic Index Settings

These settings can be adjusted on active indices:

1. **Replica Management**
   - `index.number_of_replicas`: Number of replica shards
   - `index.auto_expand_replicas`: Automatic replica adjustment (e.g., "0-5", "all", "0-all", "false")

2. **Search and Indexing Behavior**
   - `index.search.idle.after`: Idle shard detection time (Default: 30s)
   - `index.refresh_interval`: Index refresh frequency (Default: 1s, -1 to disable)
   - `index.max_result_window`: Maximum search result window (Default: 10000)
   - `index.max_inner_result_window`: Inner hits limit (Default: 100)
   - `index.max_rescore_window`: Rescore window size limit
   - `index.max_docvalue_fields_search`: DocValue fields limit
   - `index.max_script_fields`: Script fields limit (Default: 32)
   - `index.max_ngram_diff`: NGram difference limit (Default: 1)
   - `index.max_shingle_diff`: Shingle difference limit (Default: 3)
   - `index.max_refresh_listeners`: Refresh listeners limit
   - `index.analyze.max_token_count`: Token count limit for analysis
   - `index.highlight.max_analyzed_offset`: Analyzed content limit for highlighting (Default: 1000000)
   - `index.max_terms_count`: Terms query limit (Default: 65536)
   - `index.max_regex_length`: Regex length limit (Default: 1000)

3. **Routing and Allocation**
   - `index.routing.allocation.enable`: Shard allocation control (Options: all, primaries, new_primaries, none)
   - `index.routing.rebalance.enable`: Shard rebalancing control (Options: all, primaries, replicas, none)

4. **Miscellaneous**
   - `index.gc_deletes`: Deleted document retention period (Default: 60s)
   - `index.default_pipeline`: Default ingest pipeline
   - `index.final_pipeline`: Final ingest pipeline (Cannot modify `_index` field)

# Understanding and Implementing Text Analysis in Elasticsearch

## What is Text Analysis?

Text analysis is a crucial process in Elasticsearch that transforms unstructured text into a structured format optimized for search operations. This process is applied to various types of content, such as email bodies or product descriptions, to enhance searchability and data retrieval.

## When to Consider Text Analysis Configuration

Elasticsearch automatically performs text analysis during the indexing of text fields and when searching through them. However, there are specific scenarios where configuring text analysis becomes particularly important:

1. If your index contains `text` fields
2. When text searches aren't yielding expected results
3. For building a custom search engine
4. When mining unstructured data
5. To optimize searches for specific languages
6. For conducting lexicographic or linguistic research

If your index doesn't include text fields, you may not need to configure text analysis further, and you can skip the pages in this section.

## Key Components of Text Analysis

To effectively implement and utilize text analysis in Elasticsearch, it's essential to understand and configure the following components:

1. Analyzers
2. Tokenizers
3. Token filters
4. Character filters
5. Normalizers

Each of these components plays a specific role in the text analysis process and can be customized to suit your particular use case.

## Exploring Text Analysis Further

To deepen your understanding and effectively implement text analysis in Elasticsearch, consider exploring these topics:

- Overview of text analysis concepts
- Step-by-step guide to configuring text analysis
- Reference guide for built-in analyzers
- Comprehensive tokenizer reference
- Detailed token filter reference
- In-depth character filters reference
- Understanding and using normalizers

# Optimizing Shard Allocation in Elasticsearch

## Introduction to Index-Level Shard Allocation Filtering

Elasticsearch provides powerful tools for controlling the distribution of shards across your cluster. By leveraging index-level shard allocation filters, you can fine-tune where Elasticsearch places shards for specific indices. These filters work in tandem with cluster-wide allocation settings and allocation awareness features to give you granular control over your data distribution.

## Filter Types and Attributes

Shard allocation filters can be based on:

1. Custom node attributes
2. Built-in attributes:
   - `_name`: Node name
   - `_host_ip`: Host IP address
   - `_publish_ip`: Publish IP address
   - `_ip`: Either host IP or publish IP
   - `_host`: Hostname
   - `_id`: Node ID
   - `_tier`: Node's data tier role
   - `_tier_preference`: Tier preference

Index lifecycle management utilizes these filters, particularly those based on custom attributes, to orchestrate shard reallocation during phase transitions.

## Dynamic Configuration

One of the key advantages of shard allocation filters is their dynamic nature. The `cluster.routing.allocation` settings can be adjusted on-the-fly, allowing for live migration of indices between different sets of nodes. However, it's important to note that relocations only occur if they don't violate other routing constraints, such as the rule preventing primary and replica shards from residing on the same node.

## Use Case Example

For instance, you could use a custom node attribute to indicate a node's performance characteristics and use shard allocation filtering to route shards for a particular index to the most appropriate class of hardware.

## Implementing Index-Level Shard Allocation Filtering

To implement filtering based on custom node attributes, follow these steps:

1. Define custom node attributes in the `elasticsearch.yml` file or at node startup:

   ```yaml
   node.attr.size: medium
   ```

   Or when starting a node:

   ```
   ./bin/elasticsearch -Enode.attr.size=medium
   ```

2. Apply routing allocation filters to the index using one of three types: `include`, `exclude`, or `require`.

   Example: Allocate shards from the `test` index to `big` or `medium` nodes:

   ```json
   PUT test/_settings
   {
     "index.routing.allocation.include.size": "big,medium"
   }
   ```

   When using multiple filters, all conditions must be met simultaneously:
   - All `require` conditions must be satisfied
   - No `exclude` conditions can be satisfied
   - At least one `include` condition must be satisfied

   Example: Move the `test` index to `big` nodes in `rack1`:

   ```json
   PUT test/_settings
   {
     "index.routing.allocation.require.size": "big",
     "index.routing.allocation.require.rack": "rack1"
   }
   ```

## Available Index Allocation Filter Settings

- `index.routing.allocation.include.{attribute}`
- `index.routing.allocation.require.{attribute}`
- `index.routing.allocation.exclude.{attribute}`

Replace `{attribute}` with the desired node attribute.

## Advanced Usage: Wildcards and Tier Filtering

Wildcards can be used when specifying attribute values:

```json
PUT test/_settings
{
  "index.routing.allocation.include._ip": "192.168.2.*"
}
```

For `_tier` filtering, note that it's based on node roles. Only a subset of roles are considered data tier roles, and the generic data role will match any tier filtering.

# Optimizing Node Departure Handling in Elasticsearch

When a node unexpectedly leaves an Elasticsearch cluster, the system's default response can sometimes lead to unnecessary strain. This document outlines the process, potential issues, and solutions for managing node departures more efficiently.

## Default Behavior on Node Departure

When a node exits the cluster, Elasticsearch typically:

1. Elevates replica shards to primary status to replace lost primaries
2. Allocates new replica shards (if sufficient nodes are available)
3. Redistributes shards for optimal balance across remaining nodes

While this approach safeguards against data loss, it can trigger a resource-intensive "shard shuffle" that may be unnecessary if the node's absence is temporary.

## The Challenge of Premature Reallocation

Consider this scenario:

1. Node 5 experiences a network disconnection
2. Replica shards are promoted to primaries
3. New replicas are created on other nodes
4. Extensive data copying occurs across the network
5. Cluster undergoes rebalancing
6. Node 5 reconnects shortly after
7. Another rebalancing occurs to include Node 5

This process results in significant, potentially avoidable network traffic and processing load.

## Delayed Allocation: A Smarter Approach

Elasticsearch offers a solution through delayed allocation of unassigned replica shards. This feature is controlled by the `index.unassigned.node_left.delayed_timeout` setting.

### Configuring Delayed Allocation

To modify the delay timeout (default is 1 minute):

```json
PUT _all/_settings
{
  "settings": {
    "index.unassigned.node_left.delayed_timeout": "5m"
  }
}
```

### Revised Scenario with Delayed Allocation

With this setting in place, the process changes:

1. Node 5 loses connectivity
2. Replica shards are promoted to primaries
3. Master node logs a delay message for unassigned shard allocation
4. Cluster status remains yellow due to unassigned replicas
5. If Node 5 returns before timeout expiration, replicas are quickly reallocated (sync-flushed shards recover almost immediately)

Note: This setting doesn't affect primary shard promotion or initial replica assignments. It also doesn't come into effect after a full cluster restart. Additionally, in case of a master failover, the elapsed delay time is reset to the full initial delay.

## Shard Relocation Cancellation

If the delay timeout is exceeded:
- The master assigns missing shards to another node
- If the original node rejoins with matching sync-ids, any ongoing relocations are cancelled
- The existing synced shard is used for efficient recovery

The default 1-minute timeout balances quick recovery with the potential for efficient cancellation.

## Monitoring Delayed Allocations

To check the number of delayed unassigned shards:

```
GET _cluster/health
```

Look for the `delayed_unassigned_shards` value in the response.

## Handling Permanent Node Removal

If a node won't return, immediately allocate missing shards by setting the timeout to zero:

```json
PUT _all/_settings
{
  "settings": {
    "index.unassigned.node_left.delayed_timeout": "0"
  }
}
```

You can revert this setting once shard recovery begins.

# Shard Allocation in Elasticsearch: Managing Total Shards per Node

Elasticsearch's cluster-level shard allocator aims to distribute shards from a single index across multiple nodes. However, achieving an even distribution can be challenging, especially when dealing with numerous indices, varying shard sizes, or limited node resources.

## Configuring Shard Allocation Limits

To address potential imbalances, Elasticsearch provides dynamic settings that allow you to set hard limits on shard allocation:

### Index-Specific Limit

```
index.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node
```

This setting restricts the total number of shards from a specific index that can be allocated to a single node.

### Cluster-Wide Limit

```
cluster.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node
```

This setting imposes a limit on the total number of shards (regardless of index) that can be allocated to each node.

Both settings are dynamic and default to `-1`, which means unlimited shards per node. Specifically, this is defined as:

```
-1
```

The value represents the maximum number of primary and replica shards allocated to each node.

## Shard Allocation in Action

Let's examine how these settings affect shard allocation with an example:

Assume a cluster has `cluster.routing.allocation.total_shards_per_node` set to 100, with three nodes:

- Node A: 100 shards
- Node B: 98 shards
- Node C: 1 shard

If Node C fails, Elasticsearch will reallocate its shard to Node B, as allocating to Node A would exceed its 100-shard limit.

## Important Considerations

1. These settings impose hard limits that may result in some shards remaining unallocated.
2. Use these settings cautiously, as they can impact cluster performance and data availability.
3. Proper configuration requires understanding your cluster's resources and workload patterns.
4. Elasticsearch checks these settings during shard allocation to ensure the limits are not exceeded.

# Data Tier Allocation in Elasticsearch

## Understanding Index-Level Data Tier Allocation

Elasticsearch provides a powerful feature for controlling the allocation of indices to specific data tiers. This functionality is implemented through the data tier allocator, which acts as a shard allocation filter. The allocator utilizes two built-in node attributes:

1. `_tier`
2. `_tier_preference`

These attributes are determined by the data node roles assigned to each node in your Elasticsearch cluster.

## Data Node Roles and Tiers

The following data node roles correspond to different data tiers:

- `data_content`
- `data_hot`
- `data_warm`
- `data_cold`

It's important to note that the general `data` role is not considered a valid data tier and cannot be used for data tier filtering.

## Configuring Data Tier Allocation

To control the allocation of indices to specific data tiers, you can use various index-level settings. These settings allow you to include, require, or exclude certain tiers for your indices.

### Available Settings

1. `index.routing.allocation.include._tier`: Specifies which tiers the index may be allocated to.
2. `index.routing.allocation.require._tier`: Defines the tier(s) that the index must be allocated to.
3. `index.routing.allocation.exclude._tier`: Indicates which tiers the index must not be allocated to.
4. `index.routing.allocation.include._tier_preference`: Sets the preferred order of tiers for allocation.

### Examples

- To allow allocation to either warm or hot tiers, with a preference for warm:
  ```
  index.routing.allocation.include._tier_preference: data_warm,data_hot
  ```

- To restrict allocation to only the warm tier:
  ```
  index.routing.allocation.require._tier: data_warm
  ```

- To ensure an index is only allocated to the hot tier:
  ```
  index.routing.allocation.require._tier: data_hot
  ```

## Node Configuration

To designate a node's role and, consequently, its tier, use the `node.roles` setting in the node's configuration.

# Understanding Elasticsearch Mapping

Elasticsearch mapping is a crucial process that defines how documents and their fields are stored and indexed. This guide will explore the key aspects of mapping, including its definition, important settings, dynamic and explicit mapping, and how to manage mappings in your Elasticsearch cluster.

## What is Mapping?

Mapping in Elasticsearch allows you to:

- Specify which string fields should be treated as full text
- Define fields containing numbers, dates, or geolocations
- Set the format for date values
- Establish custom rules for dynamically added fields

A typical mapping definition includes:

- `_index`
- `_id`
- `_source`
- `properties`

Note: Prior to version 7.0.0, mapping definitions included a type name. This has since been removed.

## Preventing Mapping Explosion

Mapping explosion occurs when an index has too many fields, potentially causing out-of-memory errors and recovery difficulties. This is particularly problematic with dynamic mapping, where each new document might introduce new fields.

To mitigate this risk, Elasticsearch provides several settings:

1. `index.mapping.total_fields.limit`: Caps the total number of fields in an index (default: 1000).
2. `index.mapping.depth.limit`: Restricts the maximum depth for a field (default: 20).
3. `index.mapping.nested_fields.limit`: Limits the number of nested fields (default: 50).
4. `index.mapping.nested_objects.limit`: Sets the maximum number of nested JSON objects (default: 10000).
5. `index.mapping.field_name_length.limit`: Constrains the maximum length of a field name (default: Long.MAX_VALUE).

When increasing these limits, consider also raising the `indices.query.bool.max_clause_count` setting to accommodate larger queries.

For fields with many arbitrary keys, the flattened data type may be a suitable alternative.

## Dynamic Mapping

Elasticsearch's dynamic mapping feature allows you to index documents without predefined field mappings. New fields are automatically added to the index mapping when a document is indexed. This applies to both top-level mapping types and inner `object` and `nested` fields.

While convenient, it's important to note that dynamic mapping rules can be configured to customize the mapping that is used for new fields.

## Explicit Mappings

As you become more familiar with your data structure, you may want to define explicit mappings for better control and optimization. Explicit mappings can be created when:

1. Creating a new index
2. Adding fields to an existing index

### Creating an Index with Explicit Mapping

Use the create index API to define mappings when creating a new index:

```json
PUT /my-index-000001
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "age":    { "type": "integer" },
      "email":  { "type": "keyword" },
      "name":   { "type": "text" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding Fields to Existing Mappings

The put mapping API allows you to add new fields to an existing index:

```json
PUT /my-index-000001/_mapping
{
  "properties": {
    "employee-id": {
      "type": "keyword",
      "index": false
    }
  }
}
```

This example adds an `employee-id` field that is stored but not indexed or searchable.

## Updating Field Mappings

It's important to note that except for supported mapping parameters, you can't change the mapping or field type of an existing field. Attempts to do so could invalidate already indexed data. If you need to modify a field's mapping:

1. For data streams, refer to the "Change mappings and settings for a data stream" documentation.
2. For other indices, create a new index with the desired mapping and reindex your data.

To create an alternate name for a field without invalidating existing data, consider using an alias field.

## Viewing Mappings

### View Complete Index Mapping

Use the get mapping API to see the full mapping of an index:

```
GET /my-index-000001/_mapping
```

### View Specific Field Mappings

For large indices or when you only need information about particular fields, use the get field mapping API:

```
GET /my-index-000001/_mapping/field/employee-id
```

This approach is especially useful for indices with numerous fields.

# Understanding Elasticsearch Shards and Merging

## Shard Structure
Elasticsearch shards are composed of Lucene indexes, which are further divided into segments. These segments serve as the fundamental storage units within the index, housing the actual data. It's important to note that segments are immutable, meaning their content cannot be altered once created.

## Segment Management
To maintain optimal index size and performance, Elasticsearch employs a process of merging smaller segments into larger ones. This process serves two primary purposes:
1. Controlling index size
2. Removing deleted documents (expunging deletes)

The merging operation utilizes an auto-throttling mechanism, which carefully balances resource allocation between merging tasks and other critical functions like search operations.

## Merge Scheduling

Elasticsearch employs a merge scheduler, specifically the ConcurrentMergeScheduler, to oversee merge operations. This scheduler manages the execution of merges as needed, running them in separate threads. When the maximum thread count is reached, subsequent merge operations are queued until a thread becomes available.

### Configurable Settings

The merge scheduler supports a dynamic setting that can be adjusted:

```
index.merge.scheduler.max_thread_count
```

The default value for this setting is calculated using the following formula:

```
Math.max(1, Math.min(4, <<node.processors, node.processors>> / 2))
```

This formula ensures that the thread count is at least 1 and at most 4, or half the number of processors available to the node, whichever is smaller.

# Elasticsearch Similarity Module

The Similarity module in Elasticsearch defines how matching documents are scored and ranked. This module operates on a per-field basis, allowing different similarity algorithms to be applied to different fields through mapping configurations.

## Configuring Custom Similarities

While the built-in similarities are generally sufficient, advanced users can configure custom similarities through index settings. This can be done when creating an index or updating existing settings.

Example configuration:

```json
PUT /index
{
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "similarity": {
        "my_similarity": {
          "type": "DFR",
          "basic_model": "g",
          "after_effect": "l",
          "normalization": "h2",
          "normalization.h2.c": "3.0"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To apply the custom similarity to a specific field:

```json
PUT /index/_mapping
{
  "properties": {
    "title": { "type": "text", "similarity": "my_similarity" }
  }
}
```

## Available Similarity Algorithms

### 1. BM25 (Default)

BM25 is the default similarity algorithm in Elasticsearch. It's based on TF/IDF and is particularly effective for short fields like names.

Configuration options:
- `k1`: Controls non-linear term frequency normalization (default: 1.2)
- `b`: Controls document length normalization of tf values (default: 0.75)
- `discount_overlaps`: Determines if overlap tokens are ignored in norm computation (default: true)

Type name: `BM25`

### 2. DFR (Divergence from Randomness)

The DFR similarity implements the divergence from randomness framework.

Configuration options:
- `basic_model`: Choices are g, if, in, and ine
- `after_effect`: Choices are b and l
- `normalization`: Choices are no, h1, h2, h3, and z

Type name: `DFR`

### 3. DFI (Divergence from Independence)

This similarity implements the divergence from independence model.

Configuration option:
- `independence_measure`: Choices are standardized, saturated, chisquared

Note: It's recommended to retain stop words when using this similarity for good relevance. Terms with frequency less than the expected frequency will get a score of 0.

Type name: `DFI`

### 4. IB (Information Based)

The IB model is based on the concept that information content in symbolic distribution sequences is primarily determined by repetitive usage of basic elements.

Configuration options:
- `distribution`: Choices are ll and spl
- `lambda`: Choices are df and ttf
- `normalization`: Same options as DFR similarity

Type name: `IB`

### 5. LM Dirichlet

Configuration option:
- `mu`: Default is 2000

Note: Terms with fewer occurrences than predicted by the language model receive a score of 0.

Type name: `LMDirichlet`

### 6. LM Jelinek Mercer

This algorithm attempts to capture important text patterns while filtering out noise.

Configuration option:
- `lambda`: Optimal value varies (default: 0.1)
  - ~0.1 for title queries
  - ~0.7 for long queries
  - As lambda approaches 0, documents matching more query terms rank higher

Type name: `LMJelinekMercer`

### 7. Scripted Similarity

Allows custom scoring logic using scripts. Example implementation of TF-IDF:

```json
PUT /index
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "similarity": {
      "scripted_tfidf": {
        "type": "scripted",
        "script": {
          "source": "double tf = Math.sqrt(doc.freq); double idf = Math.log((field.docCount+1.0)/(term.docFreq+1.0)) + 1.0; double norm = 1/Math.sqrt(doc.length); return query.boost * tf * idf * norm;"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "field": {
        "type": "text",
        "similarity": "scripted_tfidf"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Important rules for scripted similarities:
1. Scores must be positive
2. Scores should not decrease when `doc.freq` increases (all else being equal)
3. Scores should not increase when `doc.length` increases (all else being equal)

For improved efficiency, use `weight_script` for document-independent calculations:

```json
PUT /index
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "similarity": {
      "scripted_tfidf": {
        "type": "scripted",
        "weight_script": {
          "source": "double idf = Math.log((field.docCount+1.0)/(term.docFreq+1.0)) + 1.0; return query.boost * idf;"
        },
        "script": {
          "source": "double tf = Math.sqrt(doc.freq); double norm = 1/Math.sqrt(doc.length); return weight * tf * norm;"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "field": {
        "type": "text",
        "similarity": "scripted_tfidf"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Type name: `scripted`

## Changing the Default Similarity

To change the default similarity for all fields in an index:

1. When creating the index:

```json
PUT /index
{
  "settings": {
    "index": {
      "similarity": {
        "default": {
          "type": "boolean"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. For an existing index:

```json
POST /index/_close

PUT /index/_settings
{
  "index": {
    "similarity": {
      "default": {
        "type": "boolean"
      }
    }
  }
}

POST /index/_open
```

Note: Changing the default similarity for an existing index requires closing and reopening the index.

# Elasticsearch Search and Indexing Slow Logs

Elasticsearch provides powerful logging capabilities for slow search queries and indexing operations. These logs help identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your cluster's efficiency.

## Search Slow Log

The search slow log captures lengthy search operations at the shard level, offering insights into query and fetch phases.

### Configuration

You can set thresholds for both query and fetch phases using dynamic index settings:

```yaml
index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.warn: 10s
index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.info: 5s
index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.debug: 2s
index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.trace: 500ms

index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.warn: 1s
index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.info: 800ms
index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.debug: 500ms
index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.trace: 200ms

index.search.slowlog.level: info
```

Apply these settings using the Update Index Settings API:

```json
PUT /my-index-000001/_settings
{
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.warn": "10s",
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.info": "5s",
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.debug": "2s",
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.query.trace": "500ms",
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.warn": "1s",
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.info": "800ms",
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.debug": "500ms",
  "index.search.slowlog.threshold.fetch.trace": "200ms",
  "index.search.slowlog.level": "info"
}
```

### Key Features

- Thresholds are disabled by default (set to `-1`)
- Logging levels: warn, info, debug, trace
- Shard-level logging for precise performance tracking
- The benefit of several levels is the ability to quickly "grep" for specific thresholds breached

### Log File Configuration

The search slow log file is configured in `log4j2.properties`:

```properties
appender.index_search_slowlog_rolling.type = RollingFile
appender.index_search_slowlog_rolling.name = index_search_slowlog_rolling
appender.index_search_slowlog_rolling.fileName = ${sys:es.logs.base_path}${sys:file.separator}${sys:es.logs.cluster_name}_index_search_slowlog.log
appender.index_search_slowlog_rolling.layout.type = PatternLayout
appender.index_search_slowlog_rolling.layout.pattern = [%d{ISO8601}][%-5p][%-25c] [%node_name]%marker %.-10000m%n
appender.index_search_slowlog_rolling.filePattern = ${sys:es.logs.base_path}${sys:file.separator}${sys:es.logs.cluster_name}_index_search_slowlog-%i.log.gz
appender.index_search_slowlog_rolling.policies.type = Policies
appender.index_search_slowlog_rolling.policies.size.type = SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy
appender.index_search_slowlog_rolling.policies.size.size = 1GB
appender.index_search_slowlog_rolling.strategy.type = DefaultRolloverStrategy
appender.index_search_slowlog_rolling.strategy.max = 4

logger.index_search_slowlog_rolling.name = index.search.slowlog
logger.index_search_slowlog_rolling.level = trace
logger.index_search_slowlog_rolling.appenderRef.index_search_slowlog_rolling.ref = index_search_slowlog_rolling
logger.index_search_slowlog_rolling.additivity = false
```

## Identifying Search Slow Log Origin

To trace slow queries back to their origin, you can use the `X-Opaque-ID` header. This user ID is included in the search slow logs and JSON logs.

Example search slow log entry:
```
[2030-08-30T11:59:37,786][WARN ][i.s.s.query              ] [node-0] [index6][0] took[78.4micros], took_millis[0], total_hits[0 hits], stats[], search_type[QUERY_THEN_FETCH], total_shards[1], source[{"query":{"match_all":{"boost":1.0}}}], id[MY_USER_ID],
```

Example JSON log entry:
```json
{
  "type": "index_search_slowlog",
  "timestamp": "2030-08-30T11:59:37,786+02:00",
  "level": "WARN",
  "component": "i.s.s.query",
  "cluster.name": "distribution_run",
  "node.name": "node-0",
  "message": "[index6][0]",
  "took": "78.4micros",
  "took_millis": "0",
  "total_hits": "0 hits",
  "stats": "[]",
  "search_type": "QUERY_THEN_FETCH",
  "total_shards": "1",
  "source": "{\"query\":{\"match_all\":{\"boost\":1.0}}}",
  "id": "MY_USER_ID",
  "cluster.uuid": "Aq-c-PAeQiK3tfBYtig9Bw",
  "node.id": "D7fUYfnfTLa2D7y-xw6tZg"
}
```

## Index Slow Log

The index slow log captures slow indexing operations, similar to the search slow log.

### Configuration

Configure index slow log thresholds using dynamic index settings:

```yaml
index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.warn: 10s
index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.info: 5s
index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.debug: 2s
index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.trace: 500ms
index.indexing.slowlog.level: info
index.indexing.slowlog.source: 1000
```

Apply these settings using the Update Index Settings API:

```json
PUT /my-index-000001/_settings
{
  "index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.warn": "10s",
  "index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.info": "5s",
  "index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.debug": "2s",
  "index.indexing.slowlog.threshold.index.trace": "500ms",
  "index.indexing.slowlog.level": "info",
  "index.indexing.slowlog.source": "1000"
}
```

### Key Features

- Log file name: `_index_indexing_slowlog.log`
- Control logging of `_source` field:
  - Default: First 1000 characters
  - Set to `false` or `0` to skip logging the source
  - Set to `true` to log the entire source regardless of size
- `index.indexing.slowlog.reformat`: Set to `false` to preserve original document format (default is `true`)

### Log File Configuration

The index slow log file is configured in `log4j2.properties`:

```properties
appender.index_indexing_slowlog_rolling.type = RollingFile
appender.index_indexing_slowlog_rolling.name = index_indexing_slowlog_rolling
appender.index_indexing_slowlog_rolling.fileName = ${sys:es.logs.base_path}${sys:file.separator}${sys:es.logs.cluster_name}_index_indexing_slowlog.log
appender.index_indexing_slowlog_rolling.layout.type = PatternLayout
appender.index_indexing_slowlog_rolling.layout.pattern = [%d{ISO8601}][%-5p][%-25c] [%node_name]%marker %.-10000m%n
appender.index_indexing_slowlog_rolling.filePattern = ${sys:es.logs.base_path}${sys:file.separator}${sys:es.logs.cluster_name}_index_indexing_slowlog-%i.log.gz
appender.index_indexing_slowlog_rolling.policies.type = Policies
appender.index_indexing_slowlog_rolling.policies.size.type = SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy
appender.index_indexing_slowlog_rolling.policies.size.size = 1GB
appender.index_indexing_slowlog_rolling.strategy.type = DefaultRolloverStrategy
appender.index_indexing_slowlog_rolling.strategy.max = 4

logger.index_indexing_slowlog.name = index.indexing.slowlog.index
logger.index_indexing_slowlog.level = trace
logger.index_indexing_slowlog.appenderRef.index_indexing_slowlog_rolling.ref = index_indexing_slowlog_rolling
logger.index_indexing_slowlog.additivity = false
```

# Elasticsearch Storage Configuration

## Introduction to the Store Module

The store module in Elasticsearch provides control over the storage and access of index data on disk. While this is a low-level setting, it's crucial to understand its implications on performance and resource utilization. Some store implementations have poor concurrency or disable optimizations for heap memory usage, which is why it's generally recommended to stick with the default settings.

## Storage Types

Elasticsearch offers various file system implementations, known as storage types. By default, it selects the most suitable implementation based on the operating environment. However, you can explicitly configure the storage type for all indices or on a per-index basis.

### Global Configuration

To set the storage type globally, add the following to your `config/elasticsearch.yml` file:

```yaml
index.store.type: hybridfs
```

### Per-Index Configuration

For individual index configuration, use the following JSON structure during index creation:

```json
PUT /my-index-000001
{
  "settings": {
    "index.store.type": "hybridfs"
  }
}
```

## Available Storage Types

Elasticsearch supports the following storage types:

1. `fs`
2. `hybridfs`
3. `simplefs`
4. `SimpleFsDirectory`
5. `niofs`
6. `NIOFSDirectory`
7. `mmapfs`
8. `MMapDirectory`

## Memory-Mapping Configuration

The use of `mmapfs` and `hybridfs` can be restricted using the `node.store.allow_mmap` setting. This boolean setting controls whether memory-mapping is allowed, with the default being true.

This configuration is particularly useful in environments where you cannot control the creation of memory maps and need to disable memory-mapping capabilities. For example:

```yaml
node.store.allow_mmap: false
```

## Expert-Level Configuration

It's important to note that storage type configuration is considered an expert-level setting. Exercise caution when modifying these settings, as they may impact performance and stability. Furthermore, this setting might be removed in future Elasticsearch releases.

## Recommendation

Unless you have specific requirements or expertise in this area, it's advisable to stick with the default storage settings. Elasticsearch's default choices are optimized for most use cases and provide a balance between performance and resource utilization.

# Lucene Commits and Translog in Elasticsearch

## Persistence and Recovery Mechanisms

Elasticsearch employs two primary mechanisms to ensure data durability and facilitate recovery: Lucene commits and the translog.

### Lucene Commits

Lucene commits are operations that persist changes to disk. While crucial for data durability, they are resource-intensive and cannot be performed after every index or delete operation. Consequently, changes occurring between commits may be lost in case of unexpected shutdowns or hardware failures.

### Translog

To mitigate potential data loss, each shard maintains a transaction log called the translog. This log records all index and delete operations after they've been processed by the internal Lucene index but before acknowledgment. In the event of a crash, recent acknowledged operations that weren't included in the last Lucene commit can be recovered from the translog during shard recovery.

## Elasticsearch Flush

An Elasticsearch flush involves performing a Lucene commit and initiating a new translog generation. Flushes occur automatically in the background to prevent the translog from growing excessively large, which could significantly slow down recovery times. While manual flushing is possible via an API, it's rarely necessary.

## Translog Configuration

### Durability Settings

The `index.translog.durability` setting controls how translog data is persisted:

- `request` (default): Ensures the translog is `fsync`ed and committed on the primary and all allocated replicas before reporting success to the client.
- `async`: Performs `fsync` and commits the translog at intervals specified by `index.translog.sync_interval`. This may result in loss of operations performed just before a crash when the node recovers.

### Key Settings

The following dynamically updatable per-index settings control the behavior of the translog:

- `index.translog.sync_interval`: Default is `5s`
- `index.translog.flush_threshold_size`: Default is `512mb`

These settings influence translog behavior and can be adjusted as needed.

## Translog Retention (Deprecated)

Translog retention settings have been deprecated since version 7.4.0 in favor of soft deletes. These settings are now effectively ignored and will be removed in future versions.

Previously, these settings controlled how much translog data was retained for peer recoveries:

- `index.translog.retention.size`: Default was `512mb`
- `index.translog.retention.age`: Default was `12h`

## Note on Soft Deletes

Soft deletes have replaced translog retention as the preferred method for retaining historical operations. This change improves the efficiency of replica recovery processes.

In earlier versions, when an index was not using soft deletes, Elasticsearch recovered each replica shard by replaying operations from the primary's translog. This required both primary and replica shards to preserve extra operations in their translogs to support potential rebuilding of replicas or promotion of replicas to primary status.

# History Retention in Elasticsearch

## Introduction

Elasticsearch employs a mechanism called history retention to efficiently manage and replay operations on shards. This feature is crucial for scenarios such as:

1. Bringing briefly offline replicas up to date
2. Facilitating cross-cluster replication

## Core Concepts

### Soft Deletes

Elasticsearch utilizes soft deletes to preserve recent deletion operations in the Lucene index. This allows for:

- Efficient replay of operations
- Preservation of deletion information not inherently stored in Lucene

Soft deletes are necessary because while indexed documents contain all information needed for replay, deletions do not.

### Shard History Retention Leases

To manage operation replay, Elasticsearch implements shard history retention leases. Key points include:

- Each potential replay target (e.g., replicas, follower shards) creates a lease
- Leases track the first unprocessed operation's sequence number
- As operations are processed, the lease's sequence number is updated
- Soft-deleted operations are discarded when no longer covered by any lease

## Retention Mechanism

1. Failed shard copies stop updating their leases
2. Elasticsearch preserves new operations for potential replay
3. Leases expire after a set time (default: 12 hours)
4. Expired leases allow Elasticsearch to discard history
5. Late recoveries result in full index copying

Elasticsearch balances between retaining necessary operations and preventing indefinite index growth.

## Configuration

Soft deletes are enabled by default on recent indices but can be explicitly configured:

```yaml
index.soft_deletes.enabled: true
index.soft_deletes.retention_lease.period: 12h
```

Note: Disabling soft deletes impacts peer recoveries and prevents cross-cluster replication. If soft deletes are disabled, peer recoveries may still occur by copying missing operations from the translog, as long as those operations are retained there.

## Implications

1. Balances efficient recovery with space management
2. Allows for quick recovery of briefly offline shards
3. Prevents indefinite history retention for permanently failed shards
4. Enables cross-cluster replication functionality

# Understanding and Managing Indexing Pressure in Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch, a powerful search and analytics engine, relies on efficient indexing processes to maintain optimal performance. However, the act of indexing documents can significantly impact system resources, potentially affecting overall cluster health and responsiveness. This document explores the concept of indexing pressure, its implications, and how Elasticsearch manages it to ensure system stability.

## What is Indexing Pressure?

Indexing pressure refers to the load placed on an Elasticsearch cluster due to document indexing operations. These operations consume memory and CPU resources across multiple nodes in a cluster, involving three key stages:

1. Coordinating
2. Primary
3. Replica

Indexing pressure can accumulate from various sources, including:
- External indexing requests
- Internal processes (e.g., recoveries and cross-cluster replication)

When indexing pressure becomes excessive, it can lead to:
- Cluster saturation
- Degraded search performance
- Impaired cluster coordination
- Disrupted background processing

To mitigate these risks, Elasticsearch employs internal monitoring mechanisms and rejects new indexing work when predefined limits are exceeded.

## Memory Management for Indexing Operations

Elasticsearch uses a configurable memory limit to control indexing pressure. This limit is set using the `indexing_pressure.memory.limit` node setting.

Key points about the memory limit:
- Default value: 10% of the heap
- Purpose: Restricts the number of bytes available for outstanding indexing requests
- Scope: Applies to coordinating, primary, and replica stages

### How Memory Accounting Works

1. At the start of each indexing stage, Elasticsearch accounts for the bytes consumed by the request.
2. This accounting is only released at the end of the stage.
3. Upstream stages continue to account for the request until all downstream stages complete.

Example:
- Coordinating request remains accounted for until primary and replica stages finish.
- Primary request stays accounted for until all in-sync replicas respond (enabling replica retries if necessary).

### Rejection Thresholds

1. Coordinating and Primary Stages:
   - Rejection occurs when outstanding indexing bytes exceed the configured limit.

2. Replica Stage:
   - Rejection begins when outstanding replica indexing bytes surpass 1.5 times the configured limit.
   - This design prioritizes completing outstanding replica work over accepting new coordinating and primary tasks as pressure builds.

### Caution When Adjusting the Limit

The default 10% limit is generously sized. Consider the following before modifying:
- Only indexing requests contribute to this limit.
- Additional indexing overhead (e.g., buffers, listeners) also requires heap space.
- Other Elasticsearch components need memory too.
- Setting the limit too high may deprive other operations and components of necessary memory.

## Monitoring Indexing Pressure

To gain insights into indexing pressure metrics, utilize the node stats API provided by Elasticsearch.

## Configuration

The primary setting for managing indexing pressure is:

```
indexing_pressure.memory.limit
```

Adjust this setting cautiously, considering your specific use case and system resources.

By understanding and properly managing indexing pressure, you can maintain a healthy and responsive Elasticsearch cluster, ensuring optimal performance for both indexing and search operations.

## Indexing Stages

External indexing operations go through three stages: coordinating, primary, and replica. For more detailed information on this process, refer to the Elasticsearch documentation on the Basic write model.

# Elasticsearch: The Deprecation and Removal of Mapping Types

## Introduction

Elasticsearch has undergone significant changes regarding mapping types. This document outlines the reasons behind these changes, the timeline for their implementation, and guidance for migrating to the new typeless structure.

## Understanding Mapping Types

Historically, Elasticsearch allowed multiple mapping types within a single index. Each type could represent different entities (e.g., 'user' and 'tweet' in a 'twitter' index) with their own fields. However, this approach led to complications and inefficiencies.

## Rationale for Removal

1. **Field Conflicts**: Fields with the same name across different types in an index share the same Lucene field, causing potential conflicts.
2. **Data Sparsity**: Storing diverse entities in one index can lead to sparse data, reducing Lucene's compression efficiency.
3. **Conceptual Mismatch**: The analogy of types to SQL tables was misleading, as it didn't accurately represent Elasticsearch's internal structure.

## Timeline for Removal

- **Elasticsearch 5.6**: 
  - Introduction of `index.mapping.single_type: true` setting
  - `join` field introduced as a replacement for parent-child relationships
- **Elasticsearch 6.x**:
  - Single-type-per-index enforced for new indices
  - `_type` field no longer combined with `_id` to form `_uid`
  - Deprecation of `_default_` mapping type
- **Elasticsearch 6.8**:
  - Introduction of `include_type_name` parameter (defaults to `true`)
- **Elasticsearch 7.0**:
  - `include_type_name` parameter defaults to `false`
  - Specifying types in requests deprecated
  - `_default_` mapping type removed
- **Elasticsearch 8.0**:
  - Complete removal of mapping types

## Migration Strategies

### 1. Separate Indices

Split multi-type indices into separate indices for each type:

```json
PUT users
{
  "settings": {
    "index.mapping.single_type": true
  },
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "properties": {
        "name": { "type": "text" },
        "user_name": { "type": "keyword" },
        "email": { "type": "keyword" }
      }
    }
  }
}

PUT tweets
{
  "settings": {
    "index.mapping.single_type": true
  },
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "properties": {
        "content": { "type": "text" },
        "user_name": { "type": "keyword" },
        "tweeted_at": { "type": "date" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use the Reindex API to migrate data:

```json
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "twitter",
    "type": "user"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "users",
    "type": "_doc"
  }
}

POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "twitter",
    "type": "tweet"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "tweets",
    "type": "_doc"
  }
}
```

### 2. Custom Type Field

Add a custom type field to distinguish between document types within a single index:

```json
PUT new_twitter
{
  "mappings": {
    "_doc": {
      "properties": {
        "type": { "type": "keyword" },
        "name": { "type": "text" },
        "user_name": { "type": "keyword" },
        "email": { "type": "keyword" },
        "content": { "type": "text" },
        "tweeted_at": { "type": "date" }
      }
    }
  }
}

POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "twitter"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "new_twitter"
  },
  "script": {
    "source": \"\"\"
      ctx._source.type = ctx._type;
      ctx._id = ctx._type + '-' + ctx._id;
      ctx._type = '_doc';
    \"\"\"
  }
}
```

## Parent/Child Relationships

The `join` field replaces the previous parent-child relationship implementation. It allows you to create one-to-many relationships within documents of the same index. Here's a basic example:

```json
PUT my_index
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "my_join_field": { 
        "type": "join",
        "relations": {
          "question": "answer" 
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## API Changes in Elasticsearch 7.0

### Index APIs

- Use `include_type_name=false` parameter
- Mappings directly under the `mappings` key without type names

Example:

```json
PUT /my-index-000001?include_type_name=false
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "foo": { "type": "keyword" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Document APIs

- Use `{index}/_doc/{id}` path for explicit IDs
- Use `{index}/_doc` for auto-generated IDs

Example:

```json
PUT /my-index-000001/_doc/1
{
  "foo": "baz"
}
```

### Search APIs

- Omit types from URLs
- Avoid using `_type` field in queries, aggregations, or scripts

Example of a typeless search:

```json
GET /my-index-000001/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "user_name": "kimchy"
    }
  }
}
```

### Responses

- `_type` field in responses is deprecated (returns `_doc` for typeless APIs)

Example response:

```json
{
  "_index" : "my-index-000001",
  "_type" : "_doc",
  "_id" : "1",
  "_version" : 1,
  "_seq_no" : 0,
  "_primary_term" : 1,
  "found": true,
  "_source" : {
    "foo" : "baz"
  }
}
```

### Index Templates

- Use `include_type_name=false` for typeless templates
- Templates use `_doc` type internally for backwards compatibility

Example of a typeless index template:

```json
PUT _template/template_1
{
  "index_patterns": ["*"],
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "field1": { "type": "keyword" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Handling Mixed-Version Clusters

- Specify `include_type_name` parameter in index APIs
- Typeless document APIs (e.g., `bulk`, `update`) only work with 7.0+ nodes

In 6.8, `include_type_name` defaults to `true`, while in 7.0 it defaults to `false`. Always specify this parameter explicitly in mixed-version clusters to avoid inconsistencies.

# Elasticsearch 7.10 Migration Guide

This guide outlines critical changes and considerations when upgrading your Elasticsearch application to version 7.10. For a comprehensive overview, refer to the "What's new in 7.10" and "Release notes" documentation.

## Breaking Changes

The following modifications in Elasticsearch 7.10 may significantly impact your applications. Review and address these changes before upgrading to ensure smooth operation.

### Authentication Updates

- **API Key Creation**: The `name` property is now mandatory when creating or granting API keys.

  Example:
  ```json
  {
    "api_key": {
      "name": "key-1"
    }
  }
  ```

### Java Modifications

- **MappedFieldType#fielddataBuilder**: This method now accepts an additional `Supplier<SearchLookup>` argument to support future feature development. Plugin developers should update their implementations accordingly.

### Networking Adjustments

- **TCP Keep-Alive Settings**: The maximum value for `{network,transport,http}.tcp.keep_idle` and `{network,transport,http}.tcp.keep_interval` is now 300 seconds (5 minutes). Ensure your configuration doesn't exceed this limit to avoid startup errors.

### Search Enhancements

- **Doc Value Fields Limit**: The `index.max_docvalue_fields_search` setting now applies to doc value fields returned by `inner_hits` sections and `top_hits` aggregations, in addition to the top-level `docvalue_fields` parameter. Adjust this setting as needed for your use case.

## Deprecations

The following features are deprecated in 7.10 and will be removed in 8.0. While they won't immediately affect your applications, it's recommended to update your code accordingly after upgrading.

To identify deprecated functionality in your current setup, enable deprecation logging.

### Security Configuration

1. **Transport SSL Settings**: 
   - Explicitly set `xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled` to `true` or `false` when configuring other `xpack.security.transport.ssl` settings.
   - If enabled, provide a certificate and key using either `xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path` or both `xpack.security.transport.ssl.certificate` and `xpack.security.transport.ssl.key`.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
   xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: elastic-certificates.p12
   ```

2. **HTTP SSL Settings**:
   - Explicitly set `xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled` to `true` or `false` when configuring other `xpack.security.http.ssl` settings.
   - If enabled, provide a certificate and key using either `xpack.security.http.ssl.keystore.path` or both `xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate` and `xpack.security.http.ssl.key`.

   Example:
   ```yaml
   xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: true
   xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate: elasticsearch.crt
   xpack.security.http.ssl.key: elasticsearch.key
   xpack.security.http.ssl.certificate_authorities: [ "corporate-ca.crt" ]
   ```

### Cluster Settings

- The `cluster.join.timeout` node setting is no longer necessary and will be removed in 8.0.

### Indices Access

- Direct REST API access to system indices will be restricted by default in future major versions. Certain API endpoints are exempt from this restriction, including:
  ```
  GET _cluster/health
  GET {index}/_recovery
  GET _cluster/allocation/explain
  GET _cluster/state
  POST _cluster/reroute
  GET {index}/_stats
  GET {index}/_segments
  GET {index}/_shard_stores
  GET _cat/[indices,aliases,health,recovery,shards,segments]
  ```

### Machine Learning Parameters

- Replace `allow_no_jobs` and `allow_no_datafeeds` with `allow_no_match` in machine learning APIs.

### Mapping Features

- Field-specific index-time boosts in mappings are deprecated. Use query-time boosts instead.

### Snapshot and Restore

- The repository stats API is deprecated. Use the repositories metering APIs instead.
