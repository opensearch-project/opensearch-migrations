    # This processor is currently renaming two attributes
    # that are prefixed with `log4j.context_data.` to the base attribute name
    # to make queries within OpenSearch clearer. Both the `insert from_attribute`
    # and the `delete` actions will fail silently if the attribute is not present,
    # which means that these are safe for events that both do and don't have these
    # attributes. This pattern should be extended to all of our standard attributes.
