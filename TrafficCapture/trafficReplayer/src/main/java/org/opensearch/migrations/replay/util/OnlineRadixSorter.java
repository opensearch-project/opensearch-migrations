/**
 * This provides a simple implementation to sort incoming elements that are ordered by a sequence
 * of unique and contiguous integers.  This implementation uses a PriorityQueue for staging out of order
 * elements and the memory utilization will be O(total number of items to be sequenced) in the worst case,
 * but O(1) when the items are arriving in order.
 *
 * After the item has been added, if other items were waiting for it, all the next currently sequenced
 * items are signaled.  This allows the calling context to visit the items in the natural
 * order as opposed to the order that items were added.
 *
 * When an item is next to run, that 'slot' signals via the completion of a CompletableFuture.  The future
 * signaled is the same one that was passed to the processor function in addFutureWork.  That processor
 * is responsible for setting up any work necessary when the future is signaled (compose, whenComplete, etc)
 * and returning the resultant future.  That resultant future's completion will block the OnlineRadixSorter
 * instance from proceeding to signal any subsequent signals.
 *
 * This class is NOT thread safe and is only meant to be called from a single thread.
